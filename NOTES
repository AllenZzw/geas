nanophage - Minimal prototype for phage.
============================================================

DEV NOTES
---------
- For introduced atomic constraint identifiers,
  we need to be able to:
  + Evaluate it at levels before it was introduced
  + Switch to a cheaper evaluation method thereafter
  + Detect, during conflict analysis, when it would become false.

- Need to modify env::post to call the watchers immediately,
  rather than waiting until solver::propagate.
  This avoids:
    - the same atomic constraint being posted multiple times
    - continuing to propagate after a conflict could be identified
