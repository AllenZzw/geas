nanophage - Minimal prototype for phage.
============================================================
So, phage looks like a sensible thing to do.
The problem is, of course, that there's a lot of stuff that needs to be done.

So, nanophage is essentially a proof of concept. A really small CP/LCG solver,
to test out some ideas.
It _should_ be easily extensible for additional variable kinds.
